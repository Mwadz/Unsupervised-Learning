# Unsupervised-Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithm application  and dimensionality reduction while solving business problems.


Carrefour Kenya are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax).

The project has been divided into four parts where I explored a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and provide recommendations based on the insights.

**Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction**

This section of the project entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. An analysis was also performed and provide insights gained from your analysis.
    
**Part 2: Feature Selection**

This section entails feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods. This involved analysis and insight provide on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

**Part 3: Association Rules**

This section ivolves creation of association rules that allow us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. This is done using a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

**Part 4: Anomaly Detection**

Fraud detection by checking whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset.
